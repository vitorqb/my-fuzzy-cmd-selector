* My Fuzzy Command Selector

  A tiny library I use myself that allows you to define a list of
  usefull commands you use often and select one by fuzzy matching on
  the description.

  For example, I have this to when I work with javascript:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(mfcs-add-command
 :description "Npm Javascript JS Run Test"
 :command (lambda ()
            (interactive)
            (-let ((compilation-buffer-name-function (-const "*NpmTest*"))
                   (compile-command (format "*cd %s && npm run test*")
                                    (projectile-project-root)))
              (call-interactively #'compile))))

(bind-key (kdb "C-c c") #'mfcs-call)
#+end_src

  Therefore on the rare cases I need to run tests at javascript I can
  easily press =C-c c= and the ivy selection pops up, where you can
  start typing =npm test= and run the function from this selection.

  This allows me not to have to decide and memorize a keybind for
  every single common command I can possibily use.
